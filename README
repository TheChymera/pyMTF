pyMTF 0.0.1

Python script for gauging the sharpness of optical set-ups. Named MTF after the Modulation 
Transfer Function which it tires to approximate. 


The algorithm is sketchy and offers only a rough estimate of what would be the actual MTF. The 
script was tested and optimized for images shot with a Nikon D5100. This may be especially 
important for the exif aperture key which seems to be nonstandard in Nikons. Additionally the 
picture orientation interpretation will only work for orientations commonly obtained when 
shooting with "normal" DSLRs.
